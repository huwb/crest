Intro
-----
**Crest** is a technically advanced ocean renderer implemented in Unity3D 2019.4.8 and later.

It is designed for performance and makes heavy use of Level Of Detail (LOD) strategies and GPU acceleration for fast update and
rendering. It is also highly flexible and allows a multitude of custom inputs to influence water shape/foam/waves/etc., and 
enjoys an intuitive and easy to use shape authoring interface.

The version hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/crest-ocean/crest>`_ targets the **built-in render pipeline**.
Links to the scriptable render pipeline versions (URP/HDRP) on the Asset Store may be found at the bottom of the page.
